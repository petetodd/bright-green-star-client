bright-green-star-client
========================

iOS client demo for bright-green-star-server Rails app - just a testbed to play with JSON calls between Rails and iOS.

To test it, download my bright-green-star-server (or build yourself following the instructions) and run it on localhost.  Then download the bright-green-star-client, run the app in the iPhone simulator and experiment with creating devise (secured) user accounts and associated Trip objects (e.g. trips made by the user).
